## Summary

A 25-year-old male student and part-time postman presented with sharp chest pain lasting a few seconds, starting three days ago, located over his heart and sometimes radiating to his neck. The pain worsens with coughing and lying down but improves when leaning forward. He rates the pain as 6/10 and has no other symptoms such as shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations, or viral symptoms currently, though he recently recovered from the flu. He has no significant past medical history, does not smoke or use recreational drugs, and drinks alcohol occasionally. Notably, his father recently died of a heart attack two weeks ago, which has caused him significant anxiety about his symptoms. The clinician plans to perform an ECG and possibly blood tests to evaluate his heart function and reassures him to avoid excessive worry while awaiting results.
