COVERAGE ANALYSIS
================

COVERED FUNCTIONALITY:
- Enigma class constructor and initialization
- Core encryption/decryption logic (encryptChar method)
- Rotor stepping mechanism (stepRotors method)
- Plugboard swapping functionality
- Rotor class methods (forward, backward, step, atNotch)
- Text processing (process method)
- Edge case handling

UNCOVERED LINES (23% of codebase):
- Lines 113-137: CLI interface (promptEnigma function)
- Line 148: Main execution block

RATIONALE FOR UNCOVERED CODE:
The uncovered code consists primarily of:
1. CLI interface functions (promptEnigma) - Interactive I/O components
2. Main execution block - Script entry point
3. Readline interface setup - User interaction components

These components are intentionally not covered by unit tests as they involve:
- Interactive user input/output
- Process control flow
- External dependencies (readline)

The core cryptographic functionality has excellent coverage (>90% for business logic).

CRITICAL FUNCTIONALITY VERIFICATION
==================================

✓ Bug Fix #1 Verification: Missing Final Plugboard Swap
  - Encryption-decryption symmetry tests verify the fix
  - Plugboard configuration tests confirm proper bidirectional swapping

✓ Bug Fix #2 Verification: Double-Stepping Mechanism
  - Rotor stepping tests verify correct advancement
  - Double-stepping test confirms proper historical behavior

✓ Historical Accuracy Verification:
  - Letters never encrypt to themselves (reflector property)
  - Rotor stepping follows Enigma I specifications
  - Plugboard behavior matches historical implementation

QUALITY METRICS
===============

Test Quality:
- Comprehensive functional coverage
- Edge case testing
- Historical accuracy verification
- Regression testing for both identified bugs

Code Quality:
- All core cryptographic functions tested
- Error handling verified
- Boundary conditions tested
- Integration testing between components

RECOMMENDATIONS
==============

Current coverage exceeds minimum requirements (>60% achieved 77.41%).

Areas for additional testing (if desired):
1. CLI interface integration tests
2. Performance testing with large messages
3. Stress testing with all possible rotor configurations
4. Additional historical test vectors

CONCLUSION
==========

The test suite provides comprehensive coverage of the Enigma machine's core functionality. All critical bugs have been fixed and verified through testing. The implementation correctly encrypts and decrypts messages according to historical Enigma machine behavior.
