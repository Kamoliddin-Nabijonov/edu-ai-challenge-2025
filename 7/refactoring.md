# Sea Battle Game Refactoring Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made to modernize and improve the Sea Battle game implementation. The refactoring focused on improving code organization, readability, and maintainability while preserving the core game mechanics.

## Major Changes

### 1. ES6+ Features Implementation

- Replaced `var` with `const` and `let` for better scoping
- Converted functions to ES6 classes
- Used arrow functions for callbacks and methods
- Implemented template literals for string interpolation
- Used modern array methods (map, filter, every)
- Utilized destructuring assignments
- Added async/await for promise-based operations

### 2. Code Organization

#### Class Structure
- Created `Ship` class to encapsulate ship-related logic
- Created `Board` class to manage game board operations
- Created `Player` class to handle player and CPU behavior
- Created `Game` class to control game flow

#### State Management
- Eliminated global variables
- Encapsulated state within appropriate classes
- Used private class fields where appropriate
- Improved data structure usage (Set for guesses)

### 3. Code Quality Improvements

#### Error Handling
- Added input validation
- Improved error messages
- Added return types for better function contracts

#### Naming and Readability
- Improved variable and method naming
- Added consistent code formatting
- Improved code documentation
- Separated concerns into logical units

### 4. Testing Implementation

- Added comprehensive Jest test suite
- Created unit tests for all core classes
- Implemented test coverage reporting
- Added test cases for edge conditions
- Separated test cases by functionality

## Specific Improvements

1. **Ship Management**
   - Created dedicated Ship class
   - Added ship status tracking
   - Improved ship placement logic

2. **Board Operations**
   - Simplified board creation
   - Improved position validation
   - Enhanced ship placement checks

3. **Player Logic**
   - Separated player and CPU behavior
   - Improved guess processing
   - Enhanced CPU targeting strategy

4. **Game Flow**
   - Added async/await for user input
   - Improved game state management
   - Enhanced display formatting

## Testing Coverage

The test suite covers:
- Ship creation and status
- Board management
- Ship placement
- Hit/miss processing
- CPU strategy
- Game state management

## Preserved Functionality

The following core features were maintained:
- 10x10 game board
- 3 ships per player
- Turn-based gameplay
- CPU hunt/target strategy
- Command-line interface
- Game rules and mechanics

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for future enhancement:
1. Add difficulty levels for CPU
2. Implement different board sizes
3. Add various ship types
4. Create a graphical interface
5. Add multiplayer support
6. Implement save/load functionality
